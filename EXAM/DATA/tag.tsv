BarChartReturnsForClassNotOfferedInProspectus	rr/2023	0	0	string	D	Bar Chart, Returns for Class Not Offered in Prospectus [Text]	When a Multiple Class Fund offering one or more Classes offers a new Class in a prospectus that does not offer the shares of any other Class, include the bar chart with annual total returns for any other existing Class for the first year that the Class is offered. Explain in a footnote that the returns are for a Class that is not offered in the prospectus that would have substantially similar annual returns because the shares are invested in the same portfolio of securities and the annual returns would differ only to the extent that the Classes do not have the same expenses. Include return information for the other Class reflected in the bar chart in the performance table.
