@article{LindenthalJohnson2021,
	abstract = {This paper couples a traditional hedonic model with architectural style classifications from human experts and machine learning (ML) enabled classifiers to estimate sales price premia over architectural styles, both at the building and the neighborhood-level. We find statistically and economically significant price differences for houses from distinct architectural styles across an array of specifications and modeling assumptions. Comparisons between classifications from ML models and human experts illustrate the conditions under which ML classifiers may perform at least as reliable as human experts in mass appraisal models. Hedonic estimates illustrate that the impact of architectural style on price is attenuated by properties with less well-defined styles and we find no evidence for differential price effects of Revival or Contemporary architecture for new construction.},

@inproceedings{Taltavulldelapaz2023,
	abstract = {This paper aims to forecast the long-term trend of housing prices in the Spanish cities with more than 25,000 inhabitants, a total of 275 individual municipalities. Based on a causal model explaining housing prices based on six fundamental variables (changes in population, income, number of mortgages, interest rates, vacant and housing prices), a pool VECM technique is used to estimate a housing price model and calculate the `stable long-term price', a central concept defined in the formal valuation process. The model is estimated for the period 1995--2020, and the long term is approached from 2000 to 2026, so the prediction exercise includes backcast and forecast period allowing to extract the long-term cycle housing price have followed during last 20 years and project it further 6 years. The analytical process follows three steps. Firstly, it identifies the cities following a common pattern in their housing market by clustering twice the cities: (1) using house price time series and (2) using a machine learning approach with the six fundamental variables. Results give a comprehensible evolution of the long-term component of housing prices, and the model also permits the understanding of the main drivers of housing prices in each Spanish region. Clustering cities with two statistical tools gives pretty similar results in some cities but is different in others. The challenge of finding the correct grouping is critical to understanding the housing market and forecasting their prices.},

@article{Guptaetal2022,
	abstract = {We analyze the role of macroeconomic uncertainty in predicting synchronization in housing price movements across all the United States (US) states plus District of Columbia (DC). We first use a Bayesian dynamic factor model to decompose the house price movements into a national, four regional (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West), and state-specific factors. We then study the ability of macroeconomic uncertainty in forecasting the comovements in housing prices, by controlling for a wide-array of predictors, such as factors derived from a large macroeconomic dataset, oil shocks, and financial market-related uncertainties. To accommodate for multiple predictors and nonlinearities, we take a machine learning approach of random forests. Our results provide strong evidence of forecastability of the national house price factor based on the information content of macroeconomic uncertainties over and above the other predictors. This result also carries over, albeit by a varying degree, to the factors associated with the four census regions, and the overall house price growth of the US economy. Moreover, macroeconomic uncertainty is found to have predictive content for (stochastic) volatility of the national factor and aggregate US house price. Our results have important implications for policymakers and investors.},

	abstract = {The enormous data generated on daily basis amounts to big data technologies. This large amounts of data have knowledge and hidden patterns. Real estate turning out to be another biggest application in big data. The emphasis of this paper is to map the process involved in taking large amounts of data to predict the price of a house in real estate. The real estate sounds to be a long-term investment. In this paper, the housing Sale Data from Ames, Iowa is considered for the timeframe 2006--2010 with a view to construct relevant models to estimate the final sale price of a house. Due to high number of explanatory variables several models such as linear regression, random forest and gradient boosting models have been used as tools for feature selection to determine the statistically significant characteristics that influence the final sale price of a house. It has been observed that out of all the models, the gradient boosting model returned the efficient results.},

	abstract = {Employing a large dataset (at most, the order of n = 106), this study attempts enhance the literature on the comparison between regression and machine learning-based rent price prediction models by adding new empirical evidence and considering the spatial dependence of the observations. The regression-based approach incorporates the nearest neighbor Gaussian processes (NNGP) model, enabling the application of kriging to large datasets. In contrast, the machine learning-based approach utilizes typical models: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN). The out-of-sample prediction accuracy of these models was compared using Japanese apartment rent data, with a varying order of sample sizes (i.e., n = 104, 105, 106). The results showed that, as the sample size increased, XGBoost and RF outperformed NNGP with higher out-of-sample prediction accuracy. XGBoost achieved the highest prediction accuracy for all sample sizes and error measures in both logarithmic and real scales and for all price bands if the distribution of rents is similar in training and test data. A comparison of several methods to account for the spatial dependence in RF showed that simply adding spatial coordinates to the explanatory variables may be sufficient.},

@article{TchuenteNyawa2022,
	abstract = {This paper reviews real estate price estimation in France, a market that has received little attention. We compare seven popular machine learning techniques by proposing a different approach that quantifies the relevance of location features in real estate price estimation with high and fine levels of granularity. We take advantage of a newly available open dataset provided by the French government that contains 5 years of historical data of real estate transactions. At a high level of granularity, we obtain important differences regarding the models'prediction powers between cities with medium and high standards of living (precision differences beyond 70{\%} in some cases). At a low level of granularity, we use geocoding to add precise geographical location features to the machine learning algorithm inputs. We obtain important improvements regarding the models'forecasting powers relative to models trained without these features (improvements beyond 50{\%} for some forecasting error measures). Our results also reveal that neural networks and random forest techniques particularly outperform other methods when geocoding features are not accounted for, while random forest, adaboost and gradient boosting perform well when geocoding features are considered. For identifying opportunities in the real estate market through real estate price prediction, our results can be of particular interest. They can also serve as a basis for price assessment in revenue management for durable and non-replenishable products such as real estate.},

@article{Linetal2023,
	abstract = {The housing market is of tremendous importance to the Chinese economy. Housing prices in a metropolitan like Beijing are determined not only by the structural attributes of housing units, but also by the externality stemming from local amenities and their investment potential. Meanwhile, the traditional hedonic pricing model fails to capture the latter two aspects due to its inability to capture the spatial and temporal dimensions of the housing market. In this paper, we augment the traditional model by introducing machine learning algorithms that can handle the additional complexity arising from time and space. Using a transaction-level dataset of housing prices in Beijing, we compare the performance of random forest and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and local polynomial. We find that GBM significantly outperforms the other methods in spatial prediction and sequential forecast. GBM's superior predictive capacity indicates the potential of machine learning techniques in reducing the costs of real estate appraisal, alleviating information asymmetry in the housing market, and improving people's welfare given the implications of home ownership on economic inequality and social mobility.},

@article{Deppneretal2023,
	abstract = {In this article, we examine the accuracy and bias of market valuations in the U.S. commercial real estate sector using properties included in the NCREIF Property Index (NPI) between 1997 and 2021 and assess the potential of machine learning algorithms (i.e., boosting trees) to shrink the deviations between market values and subsequent transaction prices. Under consideration of 50 covariates, we find that these deviations exhibit structured variation that boosting trees can capture and further explain, thereby increasing appraisal accuracy and eliminating structural bias. The understanding of the models is greatest for apartments and industrial properties, followed by office and retail buildings. This study is the first in the literature to extend the application of machine learning in the context of property pricing and valuation from residential use types and commercial multifamily to office, retail, and industrial assets. In addition, this article contributes to the existing literature by providing an indication of the room for improvement in state-of-the-art valuation practices in the U.S. commercial real estate sector that can be exploited by using the guidance of supervised machine learning methods. The contributions of this study are, thus, timely and important to many parties in the real estate sector, including authorities, banks, insurers and pension and sovereign wealth funds.},
