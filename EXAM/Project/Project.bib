	abstract = {Abstract Machine Learning (ML) excels at most predictive tasks but its complex nonparametric structure renders it less useful for inference and out-of sample predictions. This article aims to elucidate and enhance the analytical capabilities of ML in real estate through Interpretable ML (IML). Specifically, we compare a hedonic ML approach to a set of model-agnostic interpretation methods. Our results suggest that IML methods permit a peek into the black box of algorithmic decision making by showing the web of associative relationships between variables in greater resolution. In our empirical applications, we confirm that size and age are the most important rent drivers. Further analysis reveals that certain bundles of hedonic characteristics, such as large apartments in historic buildings with balconies located in affluent neighborhoods, attract higher rents than adding up the contributions of each hedonic characteristic. Building age is shown to exhibit a U-shaped pattern in that both the youngest and oldest buildings attract the highest rents. Besides revealing valuable distance decay functions for spatial variables, IML methods are also able to visualise how the strength and interactions of hedonic characteristics change over time, which investors could use to determine the types of assets that perform best at any given stage of the real estate investment cycle},

	abstract = {Hedonic price modelling has long been a powerful tool to estimate house prices in the real estate market. Increasingly, traditional global hedonic price models that largely ignore spatial effects are being superseded by models that deal with spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity. In addition, many novel methods integrating spatial economics, statistics and geographical information science (GIScience) have been developed recently to incorporate temporal effects into hedonic house price modelling. Here, a local spatial modelling technique, geographically weighted regression (GWR), which accounts for spatial heterogeneity in housing utility functions is applied to a 19-year set of house price data in London (1980--1998) in order to explore spatiotemporal variations in the determinants of house prices. Further, based on the local parameter estimates derived from GWR, a new method integrating GWR and time series (TS) forecasting techniques, GWR--TS, is proposed to predict future local parameters and thus future house prices. The results obtained from GWR demonstrate variations in local parameter estimates over both space and time. The forecasted future values of local estimates as well as house prices indicate that the proposed GWR--TS method is a useful addition to hedonic price modelling.},

@article{Brzezickaetal2022,
	abstract = {This paper investigates the house price cycle in 17 major cities in Poland, analysing separately prices of newly constructed housing and prices in the existing stock. We apply the Andre, Gupta and Mwamba (2019) framework and test the deepness and steepness of the cycles. Deepness concerns the relative magnitude of peaks and downturns, while steepness determines, how fast peaks or downturns are reached. When at least one of those measures is not symmetric, there is asymmetry in the cycle. We apply the triples test and the entropy test and find little evidence for asymmetry, mostly only in small cities. This seems to be intriguing, because usually there are asymmetries, for example slow price increases end in sudden drops. The explanation for the smooth cycle in the Polish housing market are a still not satisfied demand for housing and continuously growing wages. Banks issued mortgages only to the more affluent people, which were able to pay back the mortgage. Additionally, two housing subsidy schemes helped to keep house prices stable, when the situation in the global economy worsened, which might have led to price drops.},

@article{OustHansenPettrem2020,
	abstract = {Hedonic regression and repeat sales are commonly used methods in real estate analysis. While the merits of combining these models when constructing house price indices are well documented, research on the utility of adopting the same approach for residential property valuation has not been conducted to date. Specifically, house value estimates were obtained by combining predictions from repeat sales and various hedonic regression specifications, which were enhanced to account for spatial effects. Three of these enhancements---regression kriging, mixed regressive-spatial autoregressive, and geographically weighted regression---are widely utilized spatial econometric models. However, a fourth augmentation, which addresses systematic residual patterns in regressions with district indicator variables and the presence of outliers in housing data, was also proposed. The resulting models were applied to a dataset containing 16,417 real estate transactions in Oslo, Norway, revealing that when the repeat sales approach is included, it reduces the median absolute percentage error of solely hedonic models by 6.8--9.5{\%}, where greater improvements are associated with less accurate spatial enhancements. These improvements can be attributed to the inclusion of both spatial and non-spatial information inherent in previous sales prices. While the former has limited utility for well-specified spatial models, the non-spatial information that is implicit in previous sales prices likely captures otherwise difficult to observe phenomena, potentially making its contribution highly valuable in automated valuation models.},

	abstract = {This article presents a model agnostic methodology for producing property price indices. The motivation to develop this methodology is to include non-linear and non-parametric models, such as Machine Learning (ML), in the pool of algorithms to produce price indices. The key innovation is the use of individual out-of-time prediction errors to measure price changes. The data used in this study consist of 29,998 commercial real estate transactions in New York, in the period 2000--2019. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy is higher for the ML models compared to linear models. On the other hand, ML algorithms depend more on the data used for calibration; they produce less stable results when applied to small samples and may exhibit estimation bias. Hence, measures to reduce or eliminate bias need to be implemented, taking into consideration the bias and variance trade-off.},

We find statistically and economically significant price differences for houses from distinct architectural styles across an array of specifications and modeling assumptions. Comparisons between classifications from ML models and human experts illustrate the conditions under which ML classifiers may perform at least as reliable as human experts in mass appraisal models. Hedonic estimates illustrate that the impact of architectural style on price is attenuated by properties with less well-defined styles and we find no evidence for differential price effects of Revival or Contemporary architecture for new construction.},

@inproceedings{Taltavulldelapaz2023,
	abstract = {This paper aims to forecast the long-term trend of housing prices in the Spanish cities with more than 25,000 inhabitants, a total of 275 individual municipalities. Based on a causal model explaining housing prices based on six fundamental variables (changes in population, income, number of mortgages, interest rates, vacant and housing prices), a pool VECM technique is used to estimate a housing price model and calculate the `stable long-term price', a central concept defined in the formal valuation process. The model is estimated for the period 1995--2020, and the long term is approached from 2000 to 2026, so the prediction exercise includes backcast and forecast period allowing to extract the long-term cycle housing price have followed during last 20 years and project it further 6 years. The analytical process follows three steps. Firstly, it identifies the cities following a common pattern in their housing market by clustering twice the cities: (1) using house price time series and (2) using a machine learning approach with the six fundamental variables. Results give a comprehensible evolution of the long-term component of housing prices, and the model also permits the understanding of the main drivers of housing prices in each Spanish region. Clustering cities with two statistical tools gives pretty similar results in some cities but is different in others. The challenge of finding the correct grouping is critical to understanding the housing market and forecasting their prices.},

@article{Guptaetal2022,
	abstract = {We analyze the role of macroeconomic uncertainty in predicting synchronization in housing price movements across all the United States (US) states plus District of Columbia (DC). We first use a Bayesian dynamic factor model to decompose the house price movements into a national, four regional (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West), and state-specific factors. We then study the ability of macroeconomic uncertainty in forecasting the comovements in housing prices, by controlling for a wide-array of predictors, such as factors derived from a large macroeconomic dataset, oil shocks, and financial market-related uncertainties. To accommodate for multiple predictors and nonlinearities, we take a machine learning approach of random forests. Our results provide strong evidence of forecastability of the national house price factor based on the information content of macroeconomic uncertainties over and above the other predictors. This result also carries over, albeit by a varying degree, to the factors associated with the four census regions, and the overall house price growth of the US economy. Moreover, macroeconomic uncertainty is found to have predictive content for (stochastic) volatility of the national factor and aggregate US house price. Our results have important implications for policymakers and investors.},

The regression-based approach incorporates the nearest neighbor Gaussian processes (NNGP) model, enabling the application of kriging to large datasets. In contrast, the machine learning-based approach utilizes typical models: extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN). The out-of-sample prediction accuracy of these models was compared using Japanese apartment rent data, with a varying order of sample sizes (i.e., n = 104, 105, 106). The results showed that, as the sample size increased, XGBoost and RF outperformed NNGP with higher out-of-sample prediction accuracy. XGBoost achieved the highest prediction accuracy for all sample sizes and error measures in both logarithmic and real scales and for all price bands if the distribution of rents is similar in training and test data. A comparison of several methods to account for the spatial dependence in RF showed that simply adding spatial coordinates to the explanatory variables may be sufficient.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews real estate price estimation in France, a market that has received little attention. We compare seven popular machine learning techniques by proposing a different approach that quantifies the relevance of location features in real estate price estimation with high and fine levels of granularity. We take advantage of a newly available open dataset provided by the French government that contains 5 years of historical data of real estate transactions. At a high level of granularity, we obtain important differences regarding the models'prediction powers between cities with medium and high standards of living (precision differences beyond 70{\%} in some cases). At a low level of granularity, we use geocoding to add precise geographical location features to the machine learning algorithm inputs. We obtain important improvements regarding the models'forecasting powers relative to models trained without these features (improvements beyond 50{\%} for some forecasting error measures). Our results also reveal that neural networks and random forest techniques particularly outperform other methods when geocoding features are not accounted for, while random forest, adaboost and gradient boosting perform well when geocoding features are considered. For identifying opportunities in the real estate market through real estate price prediction, our results can be of particular interest. They can also serve as a basis for price assessment in revenue management for durable and non-replenishable products such as real estate.},

@article{Linetal2023,
	abstract = {The housing market is of tremendous importance to the Chinese economy. Housing prices in a metropolitan like Beijing are determined not only by the structural attributes of housing units, but also by the externality stemming from local amenities and their investment potential. Meanwhile, the traditional hedonic pricing model fails to capture the latter two aspects due to its inability to capture the spatial and temporal dimensions of the housing market. In this paper, we augment the traditional model by introducing machine learning algorithms that can handle the additional complexity arising from time and space. Using a transaction-level dataset of housing prices in Beijing, we compare the performance of random forest and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and local polynomial. We find that GBM significantly outperforms the other methods in spatial prediction and sequential forecast. GBM's superior predictive capacity indicates the potential of machine learning techniques in reducing the costs of real estate appraisal, alleviating information asymmetry in the housing market, and improving people's welfare given the implications of home ownership on economic inequality and social mobility.},

@article{Deppneretal2023,
	abstract = {In this article, we examine the accuracy and bias of market valuations in the U.S. commercial real estate sector using properties included in the NCREIF Property Index (NPI) between 1997 and 2021 and assess the potential of machine learning algorithms (i.e., boosting trees) to shrink the deviations between market values and subsequent transaction prices. Under consideration of 50 covariates, we find that these deviations exhibit structured variation that boosting trees can capture and further explain, thereby increasing appraisal accuracy and eliminating structural bias. The understanding of the models is greatest for apartments and industrial properties, followed by office and retail buildings. This study is the first in the literature to extend the application of machine learning in the context of property pricing and valuation from residential use types and commercial multifamily to office, retail, and industrial assets. In addition, this article contributes to the existing literature by providing an indication of the room for improvement in state-of-the-art valuation practices in the U.S. commercial real estate sector that can be exploited by using the guidance of supervised machine learning methods. The contributions of this study are, thus, timely and important to many parties in the real estate sector, including authorities, banks, insurers and pension and sovereign wealth funds.},
